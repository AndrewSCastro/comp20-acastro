COMP 20 Spring 2018 Private Repo for Andrew Castro

WILL FINISH SOON

What is this purpose of this Git repository?
The purpose of this Git repository is to showcase my work for the semester
in Tufts' Comp20 Web Programming course. It shows a place for all my projects including:
A responsive website that uses image spriting to change website display based on window size
A responsive website that displays song lyrics to 'Never Gonna Give You Up', using Javascript and the DOM Model
A messaging website that receives user input, stores in local storage, and displays all messages, using JQuery
A client side 'NotUber' app which demonstrated use of Javascript, JSON, and Google Maps API


What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?: 

My favorite assignment was the client side of the NotUber app. I felt it solidied
my understanding of JSON objects and Javascript functions. It was also the first 
time in the course I learned how to do use an API, the Google Maps API, which
I thought was pretty cool. It also allowed for a bit of creativity in how I passed around parameters
and variables, which gave a programming challenge similar to others I've seen in my other
programming classes at Tufts.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think my mind, and my CS mind specifically, has been opened up by this class immensely. 
I think the small misconception I had about this course was that there was a lot more
of a client focus, as I thought I'd learn to create gorgeous websites and be a master
designer. But this class isn't called web design, it's web programming and I'm glad I 
learn about the 'back end' and security side of the web as well. 


What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
The first thing is that I learned that there is so much more to web, and programming, than just writing 
code that fulfills the function that you want. 
More importantly, I learned that there isn't just one way or a 'best way' to do something,
especially in Web Programming where there is always a new latest and greatest framework. Because 
that's the case, I learned that now that I have an undestanding of basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript), I
can have the foundation to learn these new frameworks, and it's ok that I don't know all of them,
and it would be impossible for me to know all of them as well.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I think I realized I don't love back end development. After Deanna's talk, I realized that in the way she was 
excited about all this data in the back end side of things, I was more interested in the
client and more presentation side of the course. Although drawing from the early parts of the course, 
I would really love to delve deeper into design and having the knowledge of the newest frameworks and technologies
for website design, because the user side is what I feel is most tangible to me.
