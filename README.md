COMP 20 Spring 2018 Private Repo for Andrew Castro


What is this purpose of this Git repository?

The purpose of this Git repository is to showcase my work for the semester
in Tufts' Comp20 Web Programming course. It serves as a tangible and accessible 
place that displays my mini portfolio and progress in Web Programming.
It also is the go-to place where It shows a place for all my projects including:

A responsive website that uses image spriting to change website display based on window size
A responsive website that displays song lyrics to 'Never Gonna Give You Up', using Javascript and the DOM Model
A messaging website that receives user input, stores in local storage, and displays all messages, using JQuery
A client side 'NotUber' app which demonstrated use of Javascript, JSON, and Google Maps API


What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?: 

My favorite assignment was the client side of the NotUber app. I felt it solidied
my understanding of JSON objects and Javascript functions. It was also the first 
time in the course I learned how to do use an API, the Google Maps API, which
I thought was pretty cool. It also allowed for a bit of creativity in how I passed around parameters
and variables, which gave a programming challenge similar to others I've seen in my other
programming classes at Tufts.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I think my mind, and my CS mind specifically, has been opened up by this class immensely. 
I think the small misconception I had about this course was that there was a lot more
of a client focus, as I thought I'd learn to create gorgeous websites and be a master
designer. But this class isn't called web design, it's web programming and I'm glad I 
learn about the 'back end' and security side of the web as well. 


What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

I learned that there isn't just one way or a 'best way' to do something,
especially in Web Programming where there is always a new latest and greatest framework. Because 
that's the case, I learned that now that I have an undestanding of basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript), I
can have the foundation to learn these new frameworks, and it's ok that I don't know all of them,
and it would be impossible for me to know all of them as well. For example, in the Semester Group
project discussion day, there were so many new technologies such as bootstrap, SQL, etc, that I've
never personally used or even heard of, but are important regardless.

Perhaps more importantly, I learned that in order to succeed in Computer Science, you have to have
the intellectual curiosity and drive to learn things for yourself. The take home message for me
on the last day of class was when Ming said "if you don't have that intellectual curiosity", then
computer science probably isn't for you. Especially in this class that made the most sense. In Comp11
and Comp15, you are given the all the tools you need to do to complete a specific assignment, and are
told how to use them. In Comp20, Ming not only presents you all the tools you need to complete a specific 
assignment, but he goes as far to let you figure out how to use what you know to complete it. 


Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I think I realized I don't love back end development. After Deanna's talk, I realized that in the way she was 
excited about all this data in the back end side of things, I was more interested in the
client and more 'presentation' side of the course. Although drawing from the early parts of the course, 
I would really love to delve deeper into website layout and would love to have  knowledge of the newest frameworks and technologies
for website design, because the user side is what I feel is most tangible to me. Especially with a rather tiring year
in Comp15 (Data Structures) and Comp40 (Machine Structure and Programming), I find that this is even more refreshing and more interesting.
